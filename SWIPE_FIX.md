# Swipe-to-Swap Fix Documentation

## Problem Diagnosed

The swipe-to-swap feature required users to perform the same move 2+ times because of a timing/race condition issue.

### Root Cause

The original implementation in `Board.tsx` tried to simulate a swap by **calling `onTileClick` twice in sequence**:

```typescript
// OLD PROBLEMATIC CODE
onTileClick(startInfo.tileX, startInfo.tileY); // Select first tile
setTimeout(() => {
  onTileClick(targetX, targetY); // Swap with second tile
}, 16);
```

This caused multiple issues:

1. **Race Condition**: The second click would sometimes execute before the `selectedPosition` state from the first click was updated, causing the second tile to be selected instead of swapping.

2. **Long Debounce**: A 300ms debounce prevented users from making consecutive swipes quickly.

3. **Complex Timing**: Multiple nested `setTimeout` calls (16ms → 16ms → 300ms → 100ms) made the interaction unpredictable.

4. **State Confusion**: If a tile was already selected from a previous action, the code had to first deselect it, adding even more delays.

## Solution Implemented

Created a **direct swap handler** that bypasses the selection mechanism entirely:

### Changes Made

#### 1. Board Component (`apps/webclient/src/components/Board.tsx`)
- Added `onSwipe` prop to directly handle swipe gestures
- Replaced nested setTimeout calls with a single direct swap call
- Reduced debounce from 300ms to 150ms
- Simplified the touch end handler

```typescript
// NEW CODE - Direct swap
if (onSwipe) {
  setSwapDebounce(true);
  onSwipe(startInfo.tileX, startInfo.tileY, targetX, targetY);
  
  setTimeout(() => {
    setSwapDebounce(false);
    isDraggingRef.current = false;
  }, 150);
}
```

#### 2. Game Logic Hook (`apps/webclient/src/hooks/useGameLogic.ts`)
- Added `handleSwipe` function that directly sends swap to server
- Validates swap without involving selection state
- Provides same haptic feedback as before

```typescript
const handleSwipe = useCallback((x1: number, y1: number, x2: number, y2: number) => {
  const swap = { x1, y1, x2, y2 };
  
  if (!isValidSwap(boardForValidation, swap)) {
    hapticsWarning();
    return;
  }
  
  hapticsMedium();
  // Add animations and send to server
  roomRef.current.send('Input', { tClient: Date.now(), swap });
}, [playerBoard]);
```

#### 3. GameScreen & App Components
- Updated to pass `onSwipe` prop through the component tree
- No logic changes, just prop forwarding

## Benefits

✅ **Instant Response**: Swipes work on first attempt  
✅ **Faster Actions**: 150ms debounce allows quicker consecutive swipes  
✅ **No Race Conditions**: Direct swap bypasses selection state  
✅ **Cleaner Code**: Removed 4 levels of nested setTimeout calls  
✅ **Backward Compatible**: Click-to-swap mode still works as before  

## Testing Checklist

After deploying these changes:

1. ✅ Test swipe-to-swap works on first attempt
2. ✅ Test consecutive swipes work quickly
3. ✅ Test click-to-swap mode still works (in settings)
4. ✅ Test haptic feedback fires correctly
5. ✅ Test invalid swipes show warning haptic
6. ✅ Test animations play smoothly
7. ✅ Verify no console errors

## Deployment Instructions

Follow the standard rebuild process:

```bash
cd /Users/efeberk/Desktop/BrickCity/apps/mobile
pnpm run sync
```

Then in Xcode:
- Product → Clean Build Folder (⇧⌘K)
- Product → Build (⌘B)
- Product → Run (⌘R)
